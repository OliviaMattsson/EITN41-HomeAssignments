# PART TWO - Full Node
# Implement a program that takes an integer index i, another integer index j, and a set of leaves, 
# (l(0), l(1), l(2), . . . , l(n âˆ’ 1)), in a Merkle tree. 
# The leaves are given as hexadecimal strings as input, but should be interpreted as byte arrays. 
# The input is summarized in a file, starting with the integer index i, the integer index j, 
# and then followed by the leaves, one input on each line. Your program should provide:

# 1. The Merkle path for leaf l(i), starting with the sibling of l(i).
# 2. The Merkle path node at a given depth j (this will be used in the assessment). 
# 3. The resulting Merkle root (this will be used in the assessment).
