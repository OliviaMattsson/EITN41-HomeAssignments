# Implement the Luhn algorithm in your favorite language. 
# You will be given a list of card numbers with one digit censored with an “X”. 
# Use your implementation to find the censored digit in order for the card number to be valid. 
# You will be given a list of card numbers, one per line. 
# The answer is the concatenation of all censored digits, in order according to the list.
