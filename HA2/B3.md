# Summary Report on attacks
The report is about attacks using a hostile Tor node to reveal hidden servers.

## Introduction
Tor is the largest anonymity network and it uses onion routing. Resistant do DDoS attack on a hidden server since it requires a DDoS attack on the entire hidden network. It has been recommended by numerous sources to hide a server through these networks to preserve anonymity and resist censorship, but the Tor development team insists that you should not use Tor to rely on strong anonymity. 

The attacks used are cheap and fast and locates the hidden servers in a matter of minutes.

## Previous work on hiding services and anonymity
In onion routing each jump between nodes in the network removes or adds a layer, hence the name onion routing. All layers use public key encryption. The keys are shared between the client and the node that was given the key in establishing the circuit.

## Location-hidden services in Tor
One vulnerability for a hidden service in Tor is the selection of the first and last node in the path through the network. If an adversary can watch the edges (first and last node), she can confirm the identity of the one who is communicating. This is true because of the low-latency requirements, it is easy to confirm the timings
